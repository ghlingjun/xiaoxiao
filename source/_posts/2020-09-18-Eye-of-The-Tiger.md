Eye of the Tiger 是 Survivor 乐队在 1982 年应西尔维斯特史泰龙为电影《洛奇3》创作的主题曲。

Risin' up
back on the street
did my time took my chances
went the distance
now i'm back on my feet
just a man and and his will to survive
so many times
it happens too fast
you trade your passion for glory
don't lose your grip on the dreams of the past
you must fight just to keep them alive
It's the eye of the tiger
it's the thrill of the fight
risin' up to the challenge of our rival
and the last known survivor stalks his prey in the night
and he's watchin us all with the eye
of the tiger
Face to face
out in the heat
hangin' tough
stayin' hungry
they stack the odds
still we take to the street
for the kill with the will to survive
It's the eye of the tiger
it's the thrill of the fight
risin' up to the challenge of our rival
and the last known survivor stalks his prey in the night
and he's watchin us all with the eye
of the tiger
Risin' up
straight to the top
had the guts
got the glory
went the distance
now i'm not gonna stop
just a man and his will to survive
It's the eye of the tiger
it's the thrill of the fight
risin' up to the challenge of our rival
and the last known survivor stalks his prey in the night
and he's watchin us all with the eye
of the tiger
